The files at the root of this directory come from Roxane's files. The code has been modified for the
meeting of 18/01/16. Since there are not many files yet, they are placed at the root of src/. Creating subdirectories, packages, will be discuss later.

For the moment, the added files are:

- mia2_app.py (formerly essai_app.py): the script that handles the MIA2 application. For the moment, it permitts to load or create a project, choose the tags for the study and display them for each scan.
- models.py: the script that describe the several classes used in the project (Tag, Scan, Project) and two functions (serializer and deserializer).
- utils.py: script that contains some tool functions
- controller.py: script that contains tool functions
