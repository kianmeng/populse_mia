The files at the root of this directory come from Roxane's files. The code has n
ot been modified yet, but a lot of commentaries have been added and variable nam
es have been changed to make it clearer. Since there are not many files yet, the
y are placed at the root of src/. Creating subdirectories, packages, will be dis
cuss later.

Some other apps have been made by Roxane but they need Json AND Nifti files to be exploited, they may be added in the few days.

For the moment, the added files are:

- mia2_app.py (formerly essai_app.py): the script that handles the MIA2 application. For the moment, it permitts to load or create a project, choose the tags for the study and display them for each scan.
- models.py: the script that describe the several classes used in the project (Tag, Scan, Project) and two functions (serializer and deserializer).
- utils.py: script that contains some tool functions
- controller.py: script that contains tool functions
